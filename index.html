<p style="font-family: 'Josefin Sans', sans-serif;-align:center;">hello aliens! welcome to UFO .This stands for United Friends Organisation
This reffers to our group of friends that we call up as. Most of the people are from the school SKCHEC(sri kumaran childrens home) and the group is mainly assosiated to make friends with new comers and lonely, like a home for the poor(sort of).
This is like a great scope of community if you'd like to join us and make our circle of friends bigger and much powerfull. invite as many people you like and if you ever had stage fear or have a scare of meeting new people, its definetely gone by now. For better democracy and less bullying and conflicts(conflicts are kinda fun but we're preventing the big ones here) we are initiating rules and regulations.So if youre from SKCHEC , it'll be your dream to join us.
